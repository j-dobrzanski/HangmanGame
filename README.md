# HangmanGame
The main purpose of this project for me is to learn the basics of python and how to manage programming projects.

Technical issue: all of the state images should be stored in a folder named "HangmanImages" located in the same folder 
as the rest of the project.

Windowed version of hangman is mostly an adaptation of it's first version to tkinter technology. 
Some additional functions was added as a play button to play a new game withour re-opening the game widow.

However some improvments still should be made, as better representation of unguessed letters by underscores - 
there are no space without them after a first and every next guess, so it's hard to count them. 
They often (due to the length of the word and space for it as I asssume) are represented by sth more like a dot - they are much shorter 
(maybe not all of them are even shown but i haven't checked it yet).

"gamesbackend" file is the carry-over of the non-window version, it isn't neccesary as it contains the previous version of code.
